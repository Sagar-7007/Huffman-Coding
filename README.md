# Huffman-Coding
Huffman Coding Alogorithm of data compression using sequential, multi-threding and fastflow implemention.
using CPP
The FastFlow library for C++ was developed by Marco Aldinucci and Massimo Torquati at the University of Pisa, Italy. FastFlow is a programming framework specifically designed for high-performance parallel and distributed computing. It provides efficient support for both task and data parallelism, making it suitable for a wide range of parallel applications.
In FastFlow, the parallel_for class provides a simple and efficient way to parallelize loop iterations across multiple processing elements.
